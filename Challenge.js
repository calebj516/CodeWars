// Challenge: You're a square! (7 kyu)

// Description: A square of squares

// You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

// However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

// Task: Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

// In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

// The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

// My code below:

// Raising n to the power of 0.5 is the same as taking the square root of n.
// If this results in a whole number ( % 1 will result in 0 if it is a whole number) then we know that n is the square of the result and is therefore a perfect square.
const isSquare = n => (n ** 0.5) % 1 === 0;

// Tests

console.log(isSquare(-1)); // false
console.log(isSquare( 0)); // true
console.log(isSquare( 3)); // false
console.log(isSquare( 4)); // true
console.log(isSquare(25)); // true
console.log(isSquare(26)); // false
